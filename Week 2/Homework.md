# Question 1:
  Consider the following Python function:
  
    def root (a, b, c):
      discriminant = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
      return (-b - discriminant ** 0.5) / (2 * a)
  
  Which mathematical function below computes the same value as this function?
  
### Answer:
    root(a,b,c) = -b-√((b^2)-4ac) / 2a

# Question 6:
  Consider the following code snippet:
    
    row = ...
    col = ...
    nested_list = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]
