# Question 1
  Given the set of outcomes corresponding to a coin flip,{Heads,Tails}, how many sequences of outcomes of length five (repetition allowed) are possible?

### Answer
    32  (2^5 = 32)
    
----
# Question 2
  Consider a sequence of trials in which a fair four-sided die (with faces numbered 1-4) is rolled twice. What is the expected value of the product of the two die rolls? Enter the answer as a floating point number below.
  
### Answer
    6.25

# Question 3
  Given a trial in which a decimal digit is selected from the list ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"] with equal probability 0.1, consider a five-digit string created by a sequence of such trials (leading zeros and repeated digits are allowed). What is the probability that this five-digit string consists of five consecutive digits in either ascending or descending order (eg."34567" or "43210")?

  Enter your answer as a floating point number with at least four significant digits of precision.
  
### Answer
    0.0001200
    (Each outcome has probability 0.00001. There are six strings with consecutive ascending digits and six string 
     with consecutive descending digits. Therefore, the probability of this event is 0.00012.)
     
----
# Question 4
  Consider a trial in which five digit strings are formed as permutations of the digits ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]. (In this case, repetition of digits is not allowed.) If the probability of each permutation is the same, what is the probability that this five digits string consists of consecutive digits in either ascending or descending order (eg."34567" or "43210") ?

  Enter your answer as a floating point number with at least four significant digits of precision.

### Answer
    0.0003968
    There are 12 possible permutations out of 10!/5! permutations that are either ascending or descending.
